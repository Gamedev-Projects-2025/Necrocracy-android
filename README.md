## Game Overview

In order to ensure the colony’s survival, citizens are required to hold a monthly vote to select a sacrifice for the master computer, which allegedly will destroy the colony if a sacrifice isn’t made. Your survival depends on your reputation. Build and maintain it by any means necessary to avoid being the next one sacrificed. Only one will survive. Will it be you?
