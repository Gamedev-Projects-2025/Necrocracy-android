Main Objects:

Player Character

Non-Player Characters (NPCs): Other bunker inhabitants

Bunker Locations: Work area, bar, and voting room

Relationships: Score between each pair of characters

Character Traits:

Alcohol Tolerance (1–5): Determines how a character reacts to going to the bar.

Hardworking (1–5): Determines how a character reacts to going to work.

Friendliness (Multiplier): Amplifies positive reactions.

Hostility (Multiplier): Amplifies negative reactions.





The reputations values were chosen such that the crazy one would always wins the first vote to serve as a tutorial for the player on voting and such that there is always at least one character with higher or equal reputation to the player to ensure that inaction would always result in death. The character traits were chosen such that there are multiple sets of actions one player can take to survive all the votes depending on the characters present and no action can truly satisfy everyone.











Locations:

In each room you’ll be able to find a character, assuming they are alive, and an interactive item

The main hall: A central hub area that allows the player to access all of the rooms that follow.

The bar: There you can find the old party member to chat with and a bell to order yourself a drink to modify your reputation with other characters.

The factory: There you can find the husband to chat with and a punch clock to work at the factory to modify your reputation with other characters.

The voting room: There you can find the crazy one to chat with and a ballot box to cast your vote to start a voting session.

The family room: There you can find the wife to chat with.

The young party member’s room: There you can find the new party member to chat with.

The locations and item placements were chosen such that the player has to navigate through all the rooms to learn as much as possible about the other characters and to ensure his reputation is high enough to survive the vote.



Behaviour:

The NPCs behaviour towards the actions the player takes is determined by their traits and their reputation with the player.

Both traits (Alcohol tolerance and hard working) are on a scale from 1 to 5:

1 – Very negative reaction (-10 reputation points)

2 – Negative reaction (-5 reputation points)

3 – Neutral reaction (0 reputation points)

4 – Positive reaction (+5 reputation points)

5 – Very positive reaction (+10 reputation points)

Reputation can also affect dialog, and some may refuse to talk to the player if their reputation is bellow a certain threshold.



Economy:

Currently no economy system is planned for the game.









Information:

The player is given clues about the traits of the other characters and their relation with other characters through a bio screen and dialog. At the start of the game, the player is given the bio of all characters which contains clues to their traits. The player can also discover more about the other characters by talking to them and asking them questions.



Choices:

Each round the player will have to choose what to say to each character and which actions to perform based on deductions he made about the traits of other characters. The choices are turn based, at the start of each round NPCs make their choices, and only then the player makes his choices. The round ends with the player casting his vote which prompts the others to cast heir vote and the cycle continues. This was chosen so that the player can calmly and carefully make his decisions based on the all the information he has gathered so far.



Strategies:

The reputation values and traits were chosen such that the player cannot win through inaction, which is by design.

So far, no strategy is truly superior to others because they all focus on survival, and there is no guarantee that a strategy would work all the time, forcing the player to think twice and take risks. This forces the player to actually listen to other characters and to think for themselves.
