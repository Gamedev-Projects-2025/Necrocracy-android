## Playtest Ivan

1. I played through the game five times and won thrice.
2. Drinking every day was the easiest strategy but it was also possible to win by mixing drinking and working
3. Yes, but I also designed the game so I already knew everything.
4. Nope.
5. Yes, but I am the developer.

## Playtest Lidor

1. I played through the game thrice and won twice.
2. I worked and drank on every day.
3. Yes, but I also designed the game so I already knew everything.
4. Well, when a dialog shows up, you can't click on the back button until it is finished, and for me it was a little annoying. 
5. Yes, but I am the developer

## Playtest 1: Anonymous Discord Friend

1. I've played five times. I won twice and lost three times.
2. I tried alternating between the bar and work. On Day 1, I went to the bar to get a feel for the characters. Days 2 and 3, I worked to improve relationships with the Husband and Young Party Member. Then, I alternated again to keep things balanced.
3. Yes, the intro and profiles made it clear. I liked how each character's traits were reflected in their dialogue.
4. Nope, everything ran smoothly for me.
5. Not at all. It's challenging to keep everyone happy while avoiding being targeted. I lost more than I won, so I think the difficulty is just right.

## Playtest 2: Lidor's Brother

1. I lost four times and finally won on my fifth attempt.
2. I mostly worked because I thought it would make people like me more, but then I realized that I needed to socialize too. On Day 4, I switched to drinking with the Wife and Old Party Member, which helped me form alliances.
3. Yeah, but I had to reread the profiles a couple of times to figure out how traits like "Alcohol Tolerance" really worked.
4. Nope, no bugs. It was smooth.
5. No way. I thought I'd win if I just worked hard, but I kept getting voted out. You really have to plan ahead and adapt.

## Playtest 3: Ivan's Sister

1. I played three times: lost twice and won once.
2. I drank for the first two days to get the Old Party Member and Wife on my side, then switched to working to appease the Husband and Young Party Member. On the last day, I stayed neutral and avoided making any strong moves to see how alliances played out.
3. Yes, it was pretty straightforward, especially with the cutscene explaining the basics.
4. No bugs at all.
5. It's definitely not easy. Even when I won, it felt like I barely made it. The Crazy One getting eliminated early helps, but keeping the alliances balanced is tough.
