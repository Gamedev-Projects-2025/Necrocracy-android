# Necrocracy

**Death is on the ballot! Vote to kill!**

---

## Game Overview

In order to ensure the colony’s survival, citizens are required to hold a monthly vote to select a sacrifice for the master computer, which allegedly will destroy the colony if a sacrifice isn’t made. Your survival depends on your reputation. Build and maintain it by any means necessary to avoid being the next one sacrificed. Only one will survive. Will it be you?

## Game Components

### 1. Target Audience

* **Audience**: The game is designed for teenagers and older players interested in strategy and psychology-based gameplay.
* **Single-player experience**: The player competes against a group of NPCs, managing their reputation and influence to ensure survival.

### 2. Objectives

* **Primary Goal**: Maintain a high reputation among the colony members to avoid being chosen as the sacrifice. Employ any means necessary to influence the votes and ensure you’re not elected.
* **Tutorial Round**: The game starts with a mock election where the player is introduced to the game mechanics. During this round, the player’s chosen "victim" will always be sacrificed, setting the tone for the stakes of each vote.

### 3. Core Gameplay Mechanics

The gameplay cycle alternates between **Voting Segments** and **Reputation Building Segments**:

* **Voting Segments**: These are tense rounds where the player and NPCs cast their votes to decide who will be sacrificed. The NPC with the lowest reputation is generally the one sacrificed.
* **Reputation Building Segments**: Between voting rounds, the player can take actions to build their reputation, influencing other NPCs’ perceptions. Actions include:
  - **Rumor Spreading**: Create or dispel rumors to influence other NPCs’ reputations.
  - **Bar Visits**: Visit the bar to socialize and gain reputation. However, repeated use can lead to reputation decay as other NPCs grow suspicious.
  - **Other Strategic Activities**: Engage in various activities in different areas of the bunker that may increase or decrease reputation. For example, helping in the lounge may boost reputation, while rumors may cause it to decline.

The goal is to outlast all other NPCs, ensuring that you are never elected as the sacrifice and eventually become the last one standing.

### 4. Game Rules

* **Reputation System**: Each citizen has a reputation score that affects how likely they are to be voted for. This score is influenced by interactions, alliances, and rumors.
* **Voting Mechanics**: Each citizen has a vector that tracks their relationship scores with others. Citizens are more likely to vote against those with whom they have the lowest scores.
* **Player Freedom**: The player has full freedom to manipulate, negotiate, and strategize to maintain their reputation—though each action carries risk.
* **Elimination Rule**: The citizen with the lowest reputation at the end of each voting round is sacrificed.
* **Tutorial**: Players learn the game rules and key mechanics during the initial round, easing them into the strategies they’ll need to survive.

### 5. Resources

* **Reputation**: This is the primary resource, acting as a measure of social standing. Higher reputation decreases the likelihood of being voted out.
* **Reputation Management**: Reputation can be gained through various social actions and activities in the bunker, some of which are RNG-based while others rely on strategy.
* **Time-Limited Areas**: Certain areas, such as the bar, may only be accessible at specific times, and some have a capacity limit, forcing players to prioritize their activities carefully.
* **Election Forecast Program**: A tool that allows the player to analyze their survival chances based on current relationships and reputation stats.

### 6. Conflicts

**Key Conflicts**:

1. **Player vs. System**: Players must navigate obstacles and timed activities, competing for reputation boosts and strategic advantages.
2. **Moral Dilemmas**: Sacrificing other NPCs presents moral questions, as does the decision to sabotage or help others. Additionally, actions to increase reputation often come with the risk of backfiring, forcing players to make careful choices.

### 7. Setting and Map Design

* **Map Boundaries**: The player is confined to a bunker, which is structured with a variety of accessible areas, with certain sections unlocking as the game progresses.
* **Atmosphere**: The bunker is a bleak, concrete space with metal panels, evoking a sense of claustrophobia and isolation.
* **Level Design Principles**:
  - **Meaning**: Each room serves a purpose, offering a unique way to interact and affect reputation.
  - **Mobility**: Clear paths allow for quick movement between rooms and areas.
  - **Orientation**: Each section has distinct characteristics, making it easy for the player to navigate.
  - **Interest**: Every area offers a different gameplay mechanic, adding variety and depth.
  - **Guidance**: Visual cues guide the player to new areas as they unlock, gradually revealing the full scope of the bunker.

### 8. Outcomes

* **Possible Endings**:
  - **Sacrifice Ending**: The player fails to maintain their reputation and becomes the next sacrifice.
  - **Survival Ending**: The player successfully outlasts all others, emerging as the last citizen standing.
  - **Rebellion Ending**: The player gathers enough evidence to prove the sacrifices are unnecessary, convincing the remaining citizens to abandon the ritual.

* **Reputation System**: Reputation fluctuates based on player actions, allowing players to employ either luck or strategy to stay alive. NPCs can also sabotage each other, adding complexity to social dynamics.
