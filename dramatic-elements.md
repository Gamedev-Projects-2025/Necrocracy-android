## 1. Challenge:

### Skills Required:
To play the game effectively, the player must:
- **Observe Behavioral Patterns**: Analyze the reactions of other characters to their actions.
- **Deductive Reasoning**: Infer character traits and preferences based on their behavior (e.g., deducing that a character dislikes drinkers if their attitude worsens after a bar visit).

### Difficulty Levels:
At the start of the game, the player can choose between three difficulty levels:
- **Loved**: High starting reputation with all characters.
- **Neutral**: Default starting reputation with all characters.
- **Hated**: Low starting reputation with all characters.

### Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment:
The game adjusts difficulty based on the bunker’s state and the player’s skill level:
- **Early Game**: Easier to gain positive reputation as tensions are low.
- **Later Stages**: Increased difficulty due to heightened paranoia and emotional instability. Minor actions could lead to significant reputation losses.
- **Skill-Based Adjustment**: The game tracks the player’s success rate in interactions and adapts accordingly (e.g., increasing randomness or reducing forgiveness for mistakes as the player progresses).
